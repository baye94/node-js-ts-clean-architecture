# Node.js TypeScript Clean Architecture
This project was created with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## About this project

I've built a Node.js REST API project using TypeScript and MongoDB, adhering to a clean architecture. Additionally, I've included a Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration for straightforward containerization. I hope this provides a simple yet effective starting point for implementing clean architecture in Node.js.
